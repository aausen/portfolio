<h1>This is the about page</h1>
<h1>Annie Ausen</h1>

<p>Annie Ausen previously worked as a freelance orchestral musician where 
    she focused on honing her skill set independently along with bringing 
    those skills together in a large group setting. While Annie enjoyed that 
    work, she loves the challenge of using those skills in a new way. Annie 
    loves breaking things down into small parts, fixing something, seeing 
    the result of putting it back together into something larger. Annie is 
    looking to combine her love for creating and her programing skills into 
    a full stack software engineer position. </p>
